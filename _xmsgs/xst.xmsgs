<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="1767" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3034" delta="new" >In order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources, the small ROM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mrom_theta_in_mux0001</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUT. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint rom_style.
